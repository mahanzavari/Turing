# Turing Machine Palindrome Checker

This script provides a command-line simulation of a Turing Machine designed to determine if a given string from the alphabet `{a, b}` is a palindrome.

It offers a rich, interactive, and highly customizable CLI experience to visualize the step-by-step execution of the Turing Machine, making it an excellent tool for educational purposes or for anyone interested in the theory of computation.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Demo

**Fancy Mode Simulation (`-v -s fancy`)**

The default verbose mode provides a clear, color-coded, and continuously updated view of the machine's state, tape, and head position.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Complete Turing Machine Logic:** Accurately simulates a Turing Machine for palindrome recognition.
* **Interactive CLI:** Run the script with or without command-line arguments. An interactive prompt will ask for input if none is provided.
* **Verbose Simulation:** A verbose mode (`-v` or `--verbose`) allows you to watch the machine operate step-by-step.
* **Multiple Display Styles (`--style`):**
    * `fancy`: A multi-line, aesthetically pleasing display with colors and clear separation of components.
    * `compact`: A single-line display, useful for a more condensed view of the process.
* **Adjustable Speed (`--delay`):** Control the delay between steps in verbose mode to speed up or slow down the simulation.
* **Quiet Mode (`--quiet`):** Suppress all simulation output and get only the final result (`YES` or `NO`).
* **Color-Coded Output:** Utilizes `colorama` to add color to the tape, head position, and final result, enhancing readability.
* **Cross-Platform Compatible:** Clears the screen on both Windows (`cls`) and Unix-based systems (`clear`) for a clean animation effect.

## üìã Requirements

* Python 3.x
* `colorama` library

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

1.  **Clone the repository or save the code:**
    Save the Python code as a file (e.g., `turing_machine.py`).

2.  **Navigate to the script's directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Turing
    ```

3.  **Install the required dependency:**
    ```bash
    pip install colorama
    ```

## üöÄ Usage

The script can be run in several ways, from fully interactive to direct command-line execution.

### Displaying Help

To see all available options, use the `-h` or `--help` flag:
```bash
python Turing.py -h
```
```
usage: turing_machine.py [-h] [-v] [-d DELAY] [-s {fancy,compact}] [-q] [input_string]

A Turing Machine simulator for checking palindromes.

positional arguments:
  input_string          The string to check for palindrome (e.g., abba).

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v, --verbose         Enable verbose mode to see each step of the simulation.
  -d DELAY, --delay DELAY
                        Set the delay between steps in verbose mode.
  -s {fancy,compact}, --style {fancy,compact}
                        Set the display style for verbose mode.
  -q, --quiet           Run in quiet mode (only show the final result).
```

### Examples

#### 1. Interactive Mode
Simply run the script without any arguments to be prompted for input.
```bash
python turing_machine.py
```
```
Enter a string to check for palindrome (e.g., abba or ababa): abba
--- Running simulation for 'abba' ---
```

#### 2. Detailed Simulation (Fancy Style)
Use the `-v` flag to watch the simulation. This is the most illustrative mode.
```bash
python turing_machine.py ababa -v
```
*(This will start the step-by-step visual simulation.)*

#### 3. Compact Simulation
For a more condensed verbose output, use the `compact` style.
```bash
python turing_machine.py aabbaa -v -s compact
```

#### 4. Fast Simulation
To speed up the simulation, reduce the delay between steps.
```bash
python turing_machine.py abbbba -v -d 0.05
```

#### 5. Getting a Quick Answer (Quiet Mode)
To check a string and only see the final result without any simulation, use quiet mode.
```bash
python turing_machine.py abab -q
```
```
--- Running simulation for 'abab' ---

Final tape content for 'abab': NO
----------------------------------------
```
```bash
python turing_machine.py abba -q
```
```
--- Running simulation for 'abba' ---

Final tape content for 'abba': YES
----------------------------------------
```

### üß† How It Works: The Palindrome Algorithm

The Turing Machine uses the following algorithm to check for palindromes:

1.  **Read and Mark:** It starts at the leftmost character of the string, reads it ('a' or 'b'), and replaces it with a blank symbol (`B`) to mark it as processed. The machine's state "remembers" the character it just read.
2.  **Scan to the End:** It moves its head all the way to the right, past all the 'a's and 'b's, until it finds the first blank symbol.
3.  **Check the Last Character:** It moves one step left to read the last non-blank character of the current string.
4.  **Compare:**
    * If this character matches the one it remembered from the beginning, it replaces this character with a blank as well.
    * If it does not match, the machine transitions to a "reject" state (`q_no`), wipes the tape, and writes "NO".
5.  **Return to the Beginning:** If the characters matched, the machine scans all the way back to the left until it finds the first blank symbol, then moves one step right to the new "start" of the string.
6.  **Repeat:** The process repeats from step 1.
7.  **Halt Condition:**
    * If the machine is at the beginning and sees a blank symbol (meaning all characters have been successfully matched and erased), it transitions to an "accept" state (`q_yes`), wipes the tape, and writes "YES".
    * If it reaches a reject state at any point, it halts and writes "NO".
